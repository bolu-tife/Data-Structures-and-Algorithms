# Data Structure and Algorithms

A collection of my data structure and algorithm solutions split according to the Grokking the Coding Interview in 16 patterns, alongside some random leetcode questions. I try to illustrate different ways to solving the problems, including the optimal solutions. It also includes the time and space complexity for the solutions.
